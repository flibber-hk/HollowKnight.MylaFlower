# HollowKnight.MylaFlower

Mod that allows you to protect Myla from dying if you bring her the delicate flower.
- If you do not have Cdash, then there will be no change to the vanilla behaviour.
- You can still kill Myla if you do not have the delicate flower when you visit her.
- Once you have given Myla the flower, she will no longer be infected.

Thanks to
- Miikarin for making the myla flower spritesheet
- Gidge for writing the dialogue

I streamed part of the making of this mod [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1288451117).


## Localization

To provide a translation, simply make a copy of the file 
[here](https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.MylaFlower/tree/main/MylaFlower/Resources/lang/EN.json)
with the right name and text translated.
Each key can have either a single string, or a list of options (one will be chosen randomly each time).

The file can be placed in the same directory as the mod, or sent to me (e.g. make a pull request) to add it to the download.

Thanks to:
- draculino for PT_BR
